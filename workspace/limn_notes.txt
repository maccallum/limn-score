Limn consists of two parts: a duo for flute and cello, written for Stacey Pelinka and Leighton Fong of the Left Coast Chamber Ensemble; and a live electronic part premiered at the SummerWorks Performance Festival in Toronto as part of a collaboration called Synchronism with choreographer Teoma Naccarato. 

In the flute and cello duo, the two performers negotiate long, gradual changes in tempo that diverge from each other from the very start of the piece. As they are learning the piece, the musicians rely on click tracks to keep their parts aligned, but ultimately play without them in concert. The slow shifts in tempo create a performance context in which the two players cannot synchronize in the ways that they have grown to be familiar with. Instead, they must negotiate the dynamically changing relationship between their part and that of the other, dispensing with the temporal relationships prescribed in the score and instead relying on situated action in the exploration of a more rich notion of what it means to play together.

The audio drawn from Synchronism consists of traces from a series of intimate, one-on-one encounters in which Naccarato and a participant, in an enclosed space away from public view, place electronic stethoscopes and vibrotactile transducers on each otherâ€™s bodies, stimulating sites of observation and pulsation as they negotiate and explore issues of mutual trust, consent and boundaries. The stethoscope tracks are manipulated and obscured, and then projected outwards to the public. In the concert version, we hear recordings of an anonymous encounter between two people, extracted from the original bodies and environment, and redistributed in a new, shared context.
